- Research in the field of Explainable AI and Interpretable Machine Learning.
- Identified biases in models trained on healthcare (Breast Cancer Prediction) and financial risk assessment (Home Credit Default Risk Prediction) datasets. Used DenseNet, ResNet, VGG, for training.
- Identified inconsistencies in Explainability techniques and worked on creating self-interpretable models.
