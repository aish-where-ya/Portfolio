- Working under LibreHealth organization for Low Powered Models for Disease Detection and Classification for Radiology Images. Experimenting on models such as DenseNet, Inception, etc.
- Using quantization and pruning techniques to improve model performance in terms of latency, memory usage and power consumption and emulating it on ARM devices using Qemu emulator and Docker.
