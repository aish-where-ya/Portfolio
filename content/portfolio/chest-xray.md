I developed a system for classifying Chest-XRay images into 14 pathology classes. Used Conv-Nets and models such as DenseNet, Resnet and VGG-19 for this purpose. Also used localtization techniques to draw a bounding box over the affected areas of the X-ray image. Used Tensorflow and Python3 for coding.

Also built a website using Bootstrap and deployed it using a Flask server. The user can upload an image of a Chest X-Ray and the system will return the diagnosis along with a bounding box over the affected area.
