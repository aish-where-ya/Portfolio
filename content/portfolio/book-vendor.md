I developed an Android app to sell and purchase second-hand university books. Students could upload a photo and the price at which they wanted to sell their books. The books could also be categorized into the majors it was required for and the course year it was required for. Users could browse books by categories, majors, course-year among a few filters.

The app was made using Android Studio anad written in Java. It was also integrated with Firebase services where the data was stored in a NoSQL database. Details of books, their sellers, price, representative photographs were stored along with user authentication details.
