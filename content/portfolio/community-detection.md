Community Detection (or Community Search) is the process of finding sets of densely connected nodes in a graph which are structurally close to each other. The following items have been implemented in this library:

* Spectral Clustering
* Louvain Method
* Girvan-Newman algorithm

These algorithms were tested on Planted-L-Partition graph and Zachary's Karate Club Network.
