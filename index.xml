The project is called &amp;ldquo;Low Powered Models for Disease Detection and Classification for Radiology Images&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Explainable AI For Healthcare And Finance</title><link>https://aish-where-ya.github.io/portfolio/xai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 15:58:10 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://aish-where-ya.github.io/portfolio/xai/</guid><description>Research in the field of Explainable AI and Interpretable Machine Learning.
Worked in 2 fields - Finance and Healthcare.
In the Finance sector, we used the German Credit Risk dataset and trained models such as LogReg, Random Forest, XGBoost and Naive Bayes.</description></item><item><title>Chest-XRay Classification and Localization</title><link>https://aish-where-ya.github.io/portfolio/chest-xray/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 15:56:43 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://aish-where-ya.github.io/portfolio/chest-xray/</guid><description>I developed a system for classifying Chest-XRay images into 14 pathology classes. Used Conv-Nets and models such as DenseNet, Resnet and VGG-19 for this purpose. Also used localtization techniques to draw a bounding box over the affected areas of the X-ray image.</description></item><item><title>Plant Disease Detection Using An IoT Device</title><link>https://aish-where-ya.github.io/portfolio/plant-disease/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 15:55:44 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://aish-where-ya.github.io/portfolio/plant-disease/</guid><description>Developed a system that could identify diseases in crops using images of leaves.
A custom image recognition model was trained on a GPU and deployed on a Raspberry Pi.</description></item><item><title>Book Vendor</title><link>https://aish-where-ya.github.io/portfolio/book-vendor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 15:44:46 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://aish-where-ya.github.io/portfolio/book-vendor/</guid><description>I developed an Android app to sell and purchase second-hand university books. Students could upload a photo and the price at which they wanted to sell their books.</description></item><item><title>Web Portfolio</title><link>https://aish-where-ya.github.io/portfolio/portfolio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 15:44:46 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://aish-where-ya.github.io/portfolio/portfolio/</guid><description>This Website.
